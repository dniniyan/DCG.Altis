									Vehicle restriction
		Again, similar to VAS's functionality. If you want to restrict a specific vehicle you can do it or
		you can restrict an entire vehicle set by using its base class.

		Example:
		VVS_Car = ["Quadbike_01_base_F"]; //Completely removes all quadbikes for all sides
		VVS_Air = ["B_Heli_Light_01_armed_F"]; //Removes the Pawnee
